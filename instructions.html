    <h3>About</h3>
    <p>Ternary express is a simple game built to pratice basic programming concepts. With this game you'll be able to explore syntax formation as well as common functions that are part of the foundation of every good programmer.
      The game was created by Julio soon after his second week of coding at General Assembly. The initial idea was to create an adventure game that you would interact with using code, but soon changes where made to the plan in order to not waste time with visual design and create a game that would help coding noobs.
        </p>
    <h3>How it works</h3>
    <p>On the Play screen start the game by choosing "Classic" or "Challenge" both game modes are pretty similar. The point of each level is to rearange the provided prices of code into the correct order to satisfy what the instruction text is requesting. 
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><h4>Classic:</h4> <p> In this mode you can complete all the levels in order. You will always start at level one and you get as many chances as you need to complete each level</p> </li>
      <li><h4>Challenge</h4> <p>This game mode is made to suffer. It will randomly prompt any of the levels and it will end as soon as you get one level wrong. How far can you make it?</p></li>

    </ul>
