# Ternary Express

### Challenge Mode: a codin exercise challenge game. You must complete all the coding challenges with only the words and symbols provided in as little time as possible.

#### Story Mode: Inside of the Ternary Express there are many things going wrong. As the operator you will have to communicate to the staff and pansengers of the train using only **ternary operators**. 

------------
## Gameplay 

 1. Visual screen that shows dynamic text based ont the current scene <br>
 2. A board of random words, tags, and symbols to choose from in order <br>
 3. A button to go to the next scene <br>

## MVP sections
To create an MVP we will need:
- A script of the story of the game with paths
- A puzzle system to collect items and access areas in the train
- *if, if else, else* structure for answering the adventure 
- create a *() : ? =* solution to store in arrays for each structure
- A dynamic selector that lets you build the order of the solution
- A cheking feature that drives your character down a path based on how you presented your argument throuhg the solution

## Additions
- Object Oriented creation of scenes 
- Points system
- Animation?
